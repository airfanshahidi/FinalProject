# Project Proposal: Python Game

## Project Overview
This game aims to develop a python game to demonstrate the skills I have acquired taking this CS30 class. This game will be a text based RPG game inspired by the famous game Pokémon where you are able to loot and fight enemies.

## Team Members 
Airfan Shahidi (Me)

## Version Control
We will use GitHub for version control. Commits will have meaningful messages to track my progress.

## Suitibility 
The project will be approriately scaled to my skills and demonstrate my learning from CS30, including the use of data structures and libraries.

## Functionality
The game will be easy to use, execute planned features, handle errors, and include only necessary code components.

## Wow Factor
The game will aim to have clean, concise code that follows Pythons best practices. The game will be scalable and adapatable for future modifications. 

## Organization
Code and resources will be organized locally, following consistent naming conventions. The code will maintain proper indentation to follow the Pep8 style guide.

## Documentation 
User documentation will explain how to use the program. Bug fixes and changes between versions will be documented in the changelog.

## Weekly Plan
### Week 1
- Research and finalize game concept. (Done)
- Set up project respitory on GitHub (Done)
- Implement basic game mechanics and logic (June 1st)
- Desing initial user interface (June 3rd)

### Week 2
- Refine game mechanics based on personal testing (June 6th)
- Add additional gameplay features (June 7th)
- Conduct testing and debugging (June 8th)
- Finalize user interface design and documentation (June 10th)

## Risks and Challenges
Potentual risks and challenges include:
- Time for implementing my desired features
- Debugging complex code

## Target User
The games target user is someone who has played Pokémon or somebody who enjoys action RPG games.

## Must Haves
Some must haves my game needs to include are:
- A functioning menu
- Game Looping
- Functioning player and opponents
- Functioning battle system
- A friendly text based UI to help the player
- Good input handling
- HP Tracker
- A map

## Wish List
Some features my game could have if I had a longer timespan 
- More than 3 opponents
- Healing function
- Character Design??
- More power ups
- More maps

## Conclusion
The project proposal outlines the development of my game for the final project in CS30 within a 2 week timeframe.
